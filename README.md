# Vehicle-Congestive-Density-VCD-Dependent-Traffic-Control-Signal

Today in India ,the Production in  Automobile Industry is growing higher and higher when compared with the past few year. This indeed increases GDP of our country but the issue is accounted when the "Number of Vehicle on the lane increases day be day provided the capacity of the road is same ". This lead's to VCD  i.e Vehicle Congestive Density.

Our team here proposes the effective method as a application of Digital Image Processing to control the departure period of the vehicle at the junction to control vechicle congestion depending on the vehicle congestive density at a particular lane.

The Solution is consist of the following steps :
1. Capture Reference Image (An empty road of the lane whose VCD need to be determined)
2. Capturing the Sequence of Images at lane .
3. Apply various Pre processing operations. (Refer PPT )
4. Apply Canny Edge Detection Method to determine Edge.
5. Determine match value between Reference and Captured image.
6. Estimate VCD.  
7.Timing Allotment depending on VCD.

I have Included the following Documents :
1. PPT.
2. Report.
3. Matlab code (Main code and Defintion of functions).
4. Images used for Demonstration of project in ppt and report.



NOTE:Download the Matlab code and Images in the same folder while executing the code
